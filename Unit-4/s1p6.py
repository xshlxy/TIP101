Problem 6: Remove Duplicates with O(1)
Write a function remove_duplicates() that takes in a sorted list of integers nums as a parameter and removes the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input list with O(1) extra memory. The function returns the new length of the list.

def remove_duplicates(nums):
    pass
#Example Usage:

nums = [1,1,2,3,4,4,4,5]
print(nums)
print(remove_duplicates(nums))
print(nums) # same list
#Example Output:

#[1,1,2,3,4,4,4,5]
#5
#[1,2,3,4,5]
