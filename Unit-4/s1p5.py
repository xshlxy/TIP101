Write a function first_palindrome() that takes in a 
list of strings words as a parameter and returns 
the first palindromic string in the list. 
A string is palindromic if it reads the same 
forward and backward. If there is no such string, 
return an empty string ""

def first_palindrome(words):
    pass
#Example Usage:

words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
palindrome1 = first_palindrome(words)
print(palindrome1)

words2 = ["abc","racecar","cool"]
palindrome2 = first_palindrome(words2)
print(palindrome2)

words3 = ["abc", "def", "ghi"]
palindrome3 = first_palindrome(words3)
print(palindrome3)
#Example Output:

#ada
#racecar
