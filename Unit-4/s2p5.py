Problem 5: Good Substring
The sliding window technique is an algorithmic technique
often used to find a subarray or substring that meets 
certain criteria. It works by initializing two pointers
to point at the start and end of a window or 
subsection of the string/array at a time. 
The pointers are then incremented to slide the window 
and examine a different subarray or substring.

Use the sliding window technique to solve the following
 problem:

Write a function count_good_substrings() that takes in a
string s as a parameter and returns the number of good
substrings of length three. A string is good if there
are no repeated characters. A substring is a continuous
sequence of characters in a string.
If there are multiple occurrences of the same substring,
every occurrence should be counted.
