Problem 3: Evaluating Solutions
The reverse_list() problem can also be solved without 
using the two pointer technique (as you may have seen 
it in previous units)! Evaluate the time and space 
complexity of your two-pointer solution.

Then, evaluate the time and space of the following 
solution:
'''
def reverse_list(lst):
    # Create a new reversed list
    reversed_lst = lst[::-1]
    # Copy the elements back into the original list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        lst[i] = reversed_lst[i]
#Which has better time complexity?
#Which has better space complexity?
