Problem 4: Recursive Power of 2
Given an integer n, return True if n is a power of two. Otherwise, return `False``.

An integer n is a power of two if there exists an integer x such that n == 2Ë£.

Solve the problem recursively. What is the time complexity of this function?
What is the space complexity?
