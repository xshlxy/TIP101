'''
Problem 1: Hello Hello
A recursive function is a function that calls itself within the body of the function.

Step 1: Copy the recursive function repeat_hello() into Replit and run it.

Step 2: Then create another function repeat_hello_iterative() that produces 
the same output without using recursion.

Compare your iterative (non-recursive) solution to the recursive solution provided. 
What is similar? What is different?
