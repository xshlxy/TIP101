Problem 4: Count Rotations
You are given a circularly sorted list of integers. 
A circularly sorted list of integers is a sorted list whose elements 
have then been rotated some number of times such that the last element 
of the array becomes the first element of the array. 
Write a function count_rotations() that returns the total number 
of times the array is rotated. Assume there are no duplicates in the array.

#Example Usage:

# Example Input: [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6]
#Example Output:

# Expected Output: 3
# Explanation: Array is rotated 3 times:
	# Sorted Array: [2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
	# First Rotation: [10, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9]
	# Second Rotation: [9, 10, 2, 5, 6, 8]
	# Third Rotation: [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6]
