Problem 3: Binary Search IV
Thus far, weâ€™ve mostly been using an iterative implementation of 
the binary search algorithm. Recursive implementations of binary search
 are also very common. Implement binary_search() recursively.

def binary_search(nums, target):
	pass
#Example Usage:

# Example Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15], target = 11
#Example Output:

# Expected Output: 5
# Explanation: 11 has index 5 in the list
