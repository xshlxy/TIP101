Problem 5: Merge Sort I
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that takes in an unsorted list and returns a 
sorted list in O(n log n) time which is faster than many other sorting algorithms 
that have O(nÂ²) time complexity. It uses a divide and conquer approach.

Merge sort works by using a divide and conquer approach: it divides the array 
into two halves until each sublist contains only a single element, then it recursively 
sorts each sublist, and merges the sorted sublists into a sorted array.

Given the pseudo-code and helper function merge() below, implement the merge_sort() function.

# Helper function: Merges two sorted lists into one sorted list
def merge(left, right):
	result = [] # List to store the merged result
	i = j = 0 # Pointers to iterate over left and right input arrays
	
	# Compare elements from left and right halves of the list and add them to the
	# result list in the correct order
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
  # Add any remaining elements from the left half to the result list
    while i < len(left):
        result.append(left[i])
        i += 1
  
  # Add any remaining elements from the right half to the result list
    while j < len(right):
        result.append(right[j])
        j += 1
  
    return result
