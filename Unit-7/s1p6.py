Problem 6: Backwards Binary Search
Generally binary search returns the index of the first occurrence of the target in the list. 
Write an updated version of binary search find_last() that, 
given a list that may contain duplicates, returns the index of the 
last occurrence of target.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function.

def find_last(lst, target):
	pass
#Example Usage:

# Example Input: lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 11, 13, 15], target = 11
#Example Output:

# Expected Output: 6
# Explanation: The second (last) occurrence of 11 has index 6 in the list
