Problem 1: Detect Circular Linked List
A circular linked list is a linked list where the tail node points at the head node. 
Given the head of a linked list, write a function is_circular() 
that returns True if the linked list is circular and False otherwise.

Note: a circular list is more than just a cycle - specifically connecting the first and last nodes.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. 
Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def is_circular(head):
	pass
#Example Usage:

# num1 -> num2 -> num3 -> num1
print(is_circular(num1))

# var1 -> var2 -> var3
print(is_circular(var1))
#Example Output:

#True
#False
