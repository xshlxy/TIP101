Problem 6: Reverse Sublist of a Linked List
Given the head of a linked list and indices m and n, reverse the linked list between positions m and n. 
Assume the linked list uses 1-based indexing and the 0 <= m <= n <= length of list. 
Return the head of the list.

def reverse_between(head, m, n):
	pass
#Example Usage:

# input list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
reverse_between(head, 2, 5)
#Result Linked List: 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2
