Problem 4: Find the Middle
A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced in Unit 4 is to have a slow and a fast pointer that 
increment at different rates. Given the head of a linked list, use the slow-fast pointer technique to find 
the middle node of a linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for 
why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
