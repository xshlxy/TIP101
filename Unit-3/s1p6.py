def min_distance(words, word1, word2):
    pass
#Example Usage:

words = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "the"]
dist1 = min_distance(words, "quick", "jumped")
dist2 = min_distance(words, "the", "jumped")
print(dist1)
print(dist2)

words2 = ["code", "path", "code", "contribute",  "practice"]
dist3 = min_distance(words2, "code", "practice")
print(dist3)
#Example Output:

#3
