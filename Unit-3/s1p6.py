Problem 6: Minimum Distance
Write a function min_distance() that takes in a list of strings words and two strings word1 and word2' as parameters. 
The function should return the minimum distance between word1 and word2 in the list of words. 
The distance between one word and an adjacent word in the list is 1.
'''
def min_distance(words, word1, word2): 
    index1, index2 = -1, -1
    min_dist = len(words)  # Use the length of the list as the maximum possible distance
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        if word == word1:
            index1 = i
            if index2 != -1:
                min_dist = min(min_dist, index1 - index2)
        elif word == word2:
            index2 = i
            if index1 != -1:
                min_dist = min(min_dist, index2 - index1)
    return min_dist if min_dist != len(words) else -1
#Example Usage:

words = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "the"]
dist1 = min_distance(words, "quick", "jumped")
dist2 = min_distance(words, "the", "jumped")
print(dist1)
print(dist2)

words2 = ["code", "path", "code", "contribute",  "practice"]
dist3 = min_distance(words2, "code", "practice")
print(dist3)
#Example Output:

#3
#1
#2
