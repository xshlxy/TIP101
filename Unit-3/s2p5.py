Problem 5: Teemo's Attack
In the game League of Legends, Teemo attacks his enemy Ashe with poison arrows. 
Write a function find_poisoned_duration() that takes in two parameters: 
time_series (the time at which Teemo's attacks hits Ashe) and time_duration (the duration of the poisoning effect). 
The function returns the total time that Ashe is in a poisoned condition.

time_series is a list of integers that represents the times at which Teemo attacks and makes Ashe poisoned for the exact time_duration.

If Teemo hits Ashe while she is still poisoned, the poison's duration starts over. 
For example, if Teemo attacks at times 1 and 4 for 3 seconds, the states at each time would be:

1: attacked
2: in poison state
3: in poison state
4: attacked, poison duration resets to 3
5: in poison state
6: in poison state
7: in poison state 
8: in normal state
This means that the total time that Ashe is in a poisoned condition is 5.

def find_poisoned_duration(time_series, duration):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(time_series)-1):
        # Calculate the actual poisoning time between two attacks
        actual_duration = min(time_series[i+1] - time_series[i] - 1, duration)

        total += actual_duration
    # Add the duration of the last attack
    total += duration
    return total
#Example Usage:

time_series = [1,4,9]
damage = find_poisoned_duration(time_series, 3)
print(damage)
#Example Output: 8
